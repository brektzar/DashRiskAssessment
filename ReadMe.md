Risk Assessment Dashboard
This project implements a risk assessment dashboard using Dash, a Python framework for building web applications. 
The dashboard allows users to:

Identify and assess risks: 
Enter details about a risk including name, description, likelihood, and impact.
Calculate severity: 
Based on likelihood and impact, the severity level is automatically calculated using a predefined risk matrix.
Prioritize risks: 
Visualize the risk matrix and understand the severity levels based on color coding.
Add mitigation plans: Define actions, responsible parties, and deadlines for mitigating identified risks.
Generate reports: 
Export a comprehensive Excel report summarizing all recorded risks.


Functionality Overview
The application is structured as follows:

Layout:
Users interact with a form to enter risk details and action information.
A risk matrix table visually depicts the relationship between likelihood and impact, resulting in a severity level.
A list displays all added risks with details and severity information.
Buttons allow users to add risks and generate an Excel report.
Callbacks: Update the UI dynamically based on user interaction.
Validate user input when adding a new risk.
Generate the list of risks with formatted severity levels.
Create an Excel file with information and formatting for all recorded risks.

The requirements for this app is in the requirements file.
Gunicorn is for deploying on Render.

Running the application:
